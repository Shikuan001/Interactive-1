  <h1><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Web We Have to Save</strong></h1>
  <h1><strong><sup> _________________________________________</sup></strong></h1>
  <p><strong>Even before I went to jail,</strong> though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed.<br>
    Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant,<br>
    and most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by<br>
    the real world dominance of young celebrities. That philosophy is the Stream.<br></p>

<p><strong>The Stream now dominates the way people receive information on the web. <br></strong>
  Fewer users are directly checking dedicated webpages, instead getting fed by <br>
  a never-ending flow of information that’s picked for them by complex –and <br>
secretive — algorithms.The Stream means you don’t need to open so many <br>
websites any more. You don’t need numerous tabs. You don’t even need a web <br>
browser. You open Twitter or Facebook on your smartphone and dive deep in. <br>
The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have picked everything for you.<br>
According to what you or your friends have read or seen before, they predict<br>
what you might like to see. It feels great not to waste time in finding <br>
interesting things on so many websites.<br></p>

<h3><u>But are we missing something here? <br></u>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>What are we exchanging for efficiency?</u></h3>

<p><strong>In many apps, the votes we cast </strong>— <em>the likes, the plusses, the stars, the hearts</em> —<br>
are actually more related to cute avatars and celebrity status than to the substance<br>
of what’s posted. A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-looking person can<br>
be left outside the Stream, while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant<br>
Internet presence.<br></p>

<strong>_______________________________________________________________________</strong><br>

<p><strong>And not only</strong> do the algorithms behind the Stream equate newness and popularity<br>
with importance, they also tend to show us more of what we’ve already liked.<br>
These services carefully scan our behaviour and delicately tailor our news feeds<br>
with posts, pictures and videos that they think we would most likely want to see.<br></p>
