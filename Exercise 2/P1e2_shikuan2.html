<h1><u>Even before I went to jail,</U></h1>
<p>though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed.<br>
Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant,<br>
and most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by<br>
the real world dominance of young celebrities. That philosophy is the Stream.</p>

<h1><u>The Stream now dominates the<br>
way people receive information on the web.</u></h1>
<p>Fewer users are directly checking dedicated webpages, instead getting fed by<br>
a never-ending flow of information that’s picked for them by complex –and<br>
secretive — algorithms.The Stream means you don’t need to open so many<br>
websites any more. You don’t need numerous tabs. You don’t even need a web<br>
browser. You open Twitter or Facebook on your smartphone and dive deep in.<br>
The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have picked everything for you.<br>
According to what you or your friends have read or seen before, they predict<br>
what you might like to see. It feels great not to waste time in finding<br>
interesting things on so many websites.</p>

<h1><u>But are we missing something here?<br>
   What are we exchanging for efficiency?</u></h1>
<p><sup>are actually more related to cute avatars and celebrity status than to the substance<br>
of what’s posted. A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-looking person can<br>
be left outside the Stream, while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant<br>
Internet presence.</sup></p>

<h1><u>And not only</u></h1>
<p><sup>do the algorithms behind the Stream equate newness and popularity<br>
with importance, they also tend to show us more of what we’ve already liked.<br>
These services carefully scan our behaviour and delicately tailor our news feeds<br>
with posts, pictures and videos that they think we would most likely want to see.</sup></p>
