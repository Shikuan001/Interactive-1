  <h3><u><em>Even before I went to jail,</u></em> though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed.<br>
  Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant, and<br>
  most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by the<br>
  real world dominance of young celebrities. That philosophy is the Stream.</h3>

<h3><u><em>The Stream now dominates the way people receive information on the web.</em></u> Fewer<br>
users are directly checking dedicated webpages, instead getting fed by a never-ending<br>
flow of information that’s picked for them by complex –and secretive — algorithms.,<br>
The Stream means you don’t need to open so many websites any more. You don’t need<br>
numerous tabs. You don’t even need a web browser. You open Twitter or Facebook on<br>
your smartphone and dive deep in. The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have<br>
picked everything for you. According to what you or your friends have read or<br>
seen before, they predict what you might like to see. It feels great not to waste<br>
time in finding interesting things on so many websites.</h3>

<u><h1>But are we missing something here? <br>
  What are we exchanging for efficiency?</h1></u>
<h3><u><em>In many apps,</u></em> the votes we cast — the likes, the plusses, the stars, the hearts —<br>
are actually more related to cute avatars and celebrity status than to the substance<br>
of what’s posted. A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-looking person can<br>
be left outside the Stream, while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant Internet presence.<br>
And not only do the algorithms behind the Stream equate newness and popularity<br>
with importance, they also tend to show us more of what we’ve already liked.<br>
These services carefully scan our behaviour and delicately tailor our news feeds<br>
with posts, pictures and videos that they think we would most likely want to see.</h3>
