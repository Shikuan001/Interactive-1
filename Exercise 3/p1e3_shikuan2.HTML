  <h1>Even before I went to jail,</h1>
  <h2>though, the power of hyperlinks</h2>
  <h3>was being curbed. Its biggest </h3>
  <h4>enemy was a philosophy that </h4>
  <h5>combined two of the most dominant, </h5>
  <h6>and most overrated, values of our </h6>
  <h6>times: novelty and popularity, </h6>
  <h5>reflected by the real world </h5>
  <h4>dominance of young celebrities.</h4>
  <h3>That philosophy is the Stream.</h3>
  <h2>The Stream now dominates the way </h2>
  <h1>people receive information on the </h1>
  <h1>web. Fewer users are directly checking</h1>
  <h2>dedicated webpages, instead getting </h2>
  <h3>fed by a never-ending flow of information </h3>
  <h4>that’s picked for them by complex –</h4>
  <h5>and secretive — algorithms.</h5>
  <h6>The Stream means you don’t need </h6>
  <h6>to open so many websites any more.</h6>
  <h5>You don’t need numerous tabs. You </h5>
  <h4>don’t even need a web browser. You </h4>
  <h3>open Twitter or Facebook on your</h3>
  <h2>smartphone and dive deep in. The </h2>
  <h1>mountain has come to you. Algorithms </h1>
  <h1>have picked everything for you. </h1>
  <h2>According to what you or your friends </h2>
  <h3>have read or seen before, they predict</h3>
  <h4>what you might like to see. It feels</h4>
  <h5>great not to waste time in finding </h5>
  <h6>interesting things on so many websites.</h6>
  <h6>But are we missing something here? </h6>
  <h5>What are we exchanging for efficiency?</h5>
  <h4>In many apps, the votes we cast —</h4>
  <h3>the likes, the plusses, the stars,</h3>
  <h2>the hearts — are actually more related</h2>
  <h1>to cute avatars and celebrity status</h1>
  <h1>than to the substance of what’s posted.</h1>
  <h2>A most brilliant paragraph by some </h2>
  <h3>ordinary-looking person can be left </h3>
  <h4>outside the Stream, while the silly </h4>
  <h5>ramblings of a celebrity gain instant </h5>
  <h6>Internet presence.</h6>
  <h6>And not only do the algorithms behind </h6>
  <h5>the Stream equate newness and popularity </h5>
  <h4>with importance, they also tend to show </h4>
  <h3>us more of what we’ve already liked.</h3>
  <h2>These services carefully scan our behaviour </h2>
  <h1>and delicately tailor our news feeds with </h1>
  <h2>posts, pictures and videos that they think </h2>
  <h3>we would most likely want to see.</h3>
